# ES-DE Guide
A description for how to get ES-DE working with Retroarch, Steam, Heroic Games Launcher (Epic Games, GOG, Amazon Prime Games), Prism Launcher (Minecraft), Lutris, and any other games when on either Aurora (a version of Fedora) or Windows.

The explanation for Aurora is likely extremely applicable to other distributions, Aurora is just what I personally use and can verify that as of writing this these steps work on. I do not use Windows myself, so that section I am less sure about.

This was made by me solely for my brother who saw my setup and thought it was cool. If you are someone else, feel free to use it, but no promises that I will keep editing this in the future to make sure it keeps working or includes more use-cases.

## 1. Initial Setup
First, lets actually download ES-DE, and do some initial setup

1. You can simply download it [here](https://es-de.org/#Download) - If you are on Linux, select the first AppImage (except if you are on the Steam Deck, then go for the second) and if you are on Windows go for the Windows Installer download, then run through the installation process that the installer guides you through.
2. Open ES-DE
3. Click Esc, then select UI Settings, then Theme Downloader
4. Select what theme you want! For this guide, I will assume you are using "Iconic", that is my personal favorite.
5. Close ES-DE
6. Download es_Settings.xml from this repository
7. Go to C:\Program Files\ES-DE\settings (Windows) or Home/ES-DE/settings (Linux) and replace the es_Settings.xml there with the one you downloaded from this repository
8. Open the new es_Settings.xml in some text editor, it doesn't matter what program.
9. On line 135, change `<string name="ROMDirectory" value="/home/[REPLACE-THIS]/Games" />` to `<string name="ROMDirectory" value="[ROM Directory]" />` where [ROM Directory] is a folder you select somewhere on your computer. The specific location does not matter, but make sure you know what you set it as and that, ideally, the folder is empty. I used `home/Games`. 
10. Save and close es_Settings.xml

## 2. [OPTIONAL] Signing up for a Screenscraper Account
ES-DE has two websites it can scrape, which is how it gets all the fun artwork and stuff. Screenscraper, which is superior for older games, and TheGamesDB, which is superior for newer PC games. Both work without an account, but Screenscraper is slower when you aren't signed in. Thus, if you have a decent number of ROMs, it may make sense to take the few minutes to make an account.

1. Go to [this website.](https://screenscraper.fr/) Yes, I know it looks horrendous, but it has the goods we need, and once we are done here we won't ever need to lay eyes on it again.
2. At the top right, you'll see a yellow "Register" button. Click it.
3. Scroll down until you see a spot to put in a Username, Password, and Email. Fill it out.
4. Click the yellow "Send" button.
5. You may need to confirm your email, I don't remember. Check your email and do so if prompted.
6. Open ES-DE
7. Click Esc
8. Select Scraper
9. Select Account Settings
10. Put in your username and password, and make sure the option to use this account for screenscraper is turned on

## 3. Organizing Your File System
To make our lives easier further down the line, it is best to ensure that our games files are well-organized. 

1. Remember the ROM-Directory folder you selected/made in step 1.9? I hope you do. Go there in your file explorer.
2. Create a separate folder for each console you want a section on within ES-DE. 
   1. The following consoles are those with pre-made art and info for them. If you want to do another console, you can, it will just take some more work down the line, so I recommend following these names if you can. If you are, for example, emulating a DS, name the folder "nds" - keep it exactly the same as the names listed here: adam, arcade, atari5200, atari7800, atari800, atarixe, coco, colecovision, cps, dos, dreamcast, famicom, gameandwatch, gamegear, gb, gba, gbc, intellivision, lcdgames, mame, mastersystem, megacd, megacdjp, megadrivejp, model1, n3ds, n64, nds, neogeocd, neogeocdjp, nes, ngp, now-playing, pcengine, pico8, ps2, psvita, saturn, scummvm, ega32x, sega32xna, segacd, sfc, sgb, snes, snesna, steam, sufami, tg-cd, tg16, trs-80, wiiu, wonderswan, wonderswancolor, xbox, xbox360

## 4. Entering Your Games
Time to bring our games in!

### Retroarch & Other Emulators:
This part of the guide is for any game that you run through Retroarch or any other Emulator, such as Primehack, Yuzu, or Ryujinx.

1. Simply move the ROM file over to the relevant console folder inside your ROM Directory. For example, if you are emulating Pokemon White, go to the ROM Directory from steps 1.9 and 3.1, then go inside your "nds" folder, and put the Pokemon-White.nds file (or whatever its called for you) in there
2. Open ES-DE
3. Press Esc, then select "Scraper"
4. Under "Scrape from" select Screenscraper if it isn't already selected
5. Under "Scrape These Systems" select each of the systems you put ROM files into
6. Click Start and wait till it's finished
7. Go back to the main settings menu
8. Click "Other Settings"
9. Click "Alternative Emnulators"
10. For each system, select the emulator you want it to use by default. It should show Retroarch cores as well as any other standalone emulator you have installed.
11. If you want a specific game to use a different emulator than the rest of the games in the system:
   1. Navigate to the game
   2. I only know how to do this with an XBox controller. Click the Options button on the controller
   3. Click "Edit This Game's Metadata"
   4. Select "Alternative Emulator" at the bottom and change it to whatever you want

### Steam, Heroic Games Launcher, & Other Executable Games:
Any game you installed through Steam, installed through Heroic Games Launcher (a frontend that unified Epic Games, Gog, and Prime Games), or simply installed directly on your computer as an executable (and for which there is no other section in this guide). Games must be downloaded on your computer to appear in ES-DE, games you for example own on steam but don't have installed won't work. For linux users, it takes more effort if Steam is installed through flatpak - check that section seperately.

1. [ü™ü WINDOWS ONLY ü™ü] Go to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs and find all files that are the name of a game then .url - for example Undertale.url. Select all these files and copy them. Go to your ROM Directory from steps 1.9 and 3.1, then go inside your "steam" or "pc" or whatever folder (whichever you prefer), and paste the files.
   1. If your C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs is empty or doesn't have the games, maybe try checking AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\ instead. They should be in one of the two.
2. [üêß LINUX ONLY üêß] Find your .desktop files for each game you have. Select all these files and copy them. Go to your ROM Directory from steps 1.9 and 3.1, then go inside your "steam" or "pc" folder (whichever you prefer), and paste the files.
3. Open ES-DE
4. Press Esc, then select "Scraper"
5. Under "Scrape from" select TheGamesDB if it isn't already selected
6. Under "Scrape These Systems" select each of the systems you put the .url or .desktop into
7. Click Start and wait till it's finished

### Steam (Flatpak):
If you installed Steam through flatpak, it takes a little more work to get your games working through ES-DE unfortunately due to [this open issue](https://github.com/flathub/com.valvesoftware.Steam/issues/85). If you don't know what flatpak is, ignore this section.

1. Remember the ROM-Directory folder you selected/made in step 1.9? I hope you do. Go there in your file explorer.
2. Go into your folder for these games - perhaps "steam" or "pc" or so on.
3. Make a file with the name of a game installed through this method, then .sh. So, for example. "Undertale.sh".
4. Open the file
   1. If it is a steam game, paste the following into the file:  
      `#!/bin/bash `     
      `flatpak run com.valvesoftware.Steam :steam steam://rungameid/200260`
      1. Replace the number at the end with the App ID from the game on the website [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) - for example, for Undertale it is 391540
      2. Save the file and close it
3. Open ES-DE
4. Press Esc, then select "Scraper"
5. Under "Scrape from" select TheGamesDB if it isn't already selected
6. Under "Scrape These Systems" select each of the systems you put the .url or .desktop into
7. Click Start and wait till it's finished

### Prism Launcher:
This is the section for if you want to run a specific instance of Minecraft from within ES-DE. This can be a specific set of mods, resource packs, shaderpacks, settings, or so on.

1. Open Prism Launcher
2. Click on the name of the instance you want to add to ES-DE
3. Click on "Create Shortcut" in the far right, and it will open a menu to create a file. Name the file whatever you want the name to be in ES-DE, and place it inside the folder thats in your ROM-Directory you want the instance to be in - perhaps "steam" or "pc" or so on.
8. Open ES-DE
4. Press Esc, then select "Scraper"
5. Under "Scrape from" select TheGamesDB if it isn't already selected
6. Under "Scrape These Systems" select each of the systems you put the .url or .desktop into
7. Click Start and wait till it's finished
8. This probably won't work unless your instance is simply named "Minecraft" or "Minecraft: Java Edition" - metadata will probably need to be brought in automatically, check the next section on manually adding metadata.

### Lutris:
Lutris is a way to run games on Linux, if you are on Windows this section is useless to you. 

1. Open Lutris
2. Right click on the game you want to add to ES-DE
3. Click on "Create Application Menu Shortcut"
4. [ü™ü WINDOWS ONLY ü™ü] Go to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs and find all files that are the name of a game then .url - for example Undertale.url. Select all these files and copy them. Go to your ROM Directory from steps 1.9 and 3.1, then go inside your "steam" or "pc" or whatever folder (whichever you prefer), and paste the files.
   1. If your C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs is empty or doesn't have the games, maybe try checking AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\ instead. They should be in one of the two.
2. [üêß LINUX ONLY üêß] Find your .desktop files for each game you have. Select all these files and copy them. Go to your ROM Directory from steps 1.9 and 3.1, then go inside your "steam" or "pc" folder (whichever you prefer), and paste the files.
8. Open ES-DE
4. Press Esc, then select "Scraper"
5. Under "Scrape from" select Screenscraper if it isn't already selected
6. Under "Scrape These Systems" select each of the systems you put the .url or .desktop into
7. Click Start and wait till it's finished.

## 5. Customizing Metadata
Sometimes the scrapers dont work perfectly, and we need to manually fix some stuff.

### Changing Game Information:
This section doesn't concern artwork, as that's harder to change - it just concerns the written information for each game.

1. If you have an XBox Controller handy:
   2. Open ES-De
   3. Navigate to the game you want to change the information about
   4. Click the Options Button on your controller
   5. Select "Edit This Game's Metadata"
   6. Adjust whatever it is you aren't happy with!
2. If you dont have a controller handy:
   8. Open your file manager
   9. If on Windows, Navigate to C:\Users\<username>\ES-DE. If on Linux, go to /home/<username>/ES-DE. Then go in the gamelists folder, and then the folder for the system the game you want to change is in.
   10. Open gamelist.xml inside a text editor like Notepad or KWrite.
   11. You can edit the information for the game inside this file. Not as easy as with an XBox Controller, sorry.

### Changing Game Artwork:
This section focuses on the artwork for the game shown in ES-DE.

1. Open your file manager
2. If on Windows, Navigate to C:\Users\<username>\ES-DE. If on Linux, go to /home/<username>/ES-DE.
3. Open downloaded_media, then the folder for the system that has the game you want to change
4. There are a series of folders here for the different kinds of art, already pregenerated by the scrapers. Simply replace or add any artwork you would like, but make sure it is named exactly the same as the gamefile inside your ROM-Directory. For example, if your game is Undertale.desktop, your cover art should be Undertale.png
5. Open ES-DE
4. Press Esc, then select "Scraper"
5. Under "Scrape These Systems" select each of the systems that have games you are changing the artwork for
6. Select "Miximage Settings"
7. At the very bottom of this menu, select "Offline Generator"
8. Click Start and wait till it's finished.
